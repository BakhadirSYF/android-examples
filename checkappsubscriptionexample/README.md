# Check App Subscription Example

This is a simple example application that shows how you could check the current app's current and available subscriptions as well as metered information.

To properly try this example, create your own version of this example (with your own package name).  Then add the app on Clover Developer portal and upload the apk.  Add subscriptions and/or metered information on the app and install it on your test merchant account.  After a cloud sync happens (should be automatic or could be triggered by sync button on App Market), the example app should work properly pulling down the App information.
